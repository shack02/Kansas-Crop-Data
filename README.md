# Crop Identification
TODO: Create data for majority crop of each field (from union dataset) for each county compared to survey data.

Create graphs and tables for sorghum soy and cotton.

Compare majority field crop to threshold field crop.

Show that simple majority is an overestimate compared to county data and threshold data more accurately reflects county data on a county by county basis.
